# Exploring-Starbucks-Competitive-Struggles-and-Market-Positioning
In this unstructured data analysis project, we investigated Starbucks' competitive positioning and customer perception amid declining sales and internal challenges.

Our analysis was based on customer feedback and social media data to uncover key insights into how Starbucks is currently perceived and what factors contribute to its struggles.

### Problem Statement:
Starbucks has experienced a **3% decline** in same-store sales growth YoY (Year-over-Year) and faced challenges such as increasing coffee prices and leadership instability. The project aimed to understand how **brand perception**, **pricing concerns**, and **customer preferences** contribute to this decline.

### Key Analysis Components:

1. **Brand Positioning**:
   - We analyzed Starbucks' focus on **employee-centric messaging** and its positioning as a **premium brand**. The goal was to identify whether these strategies were aligned with customer expectations.

2. **Customer Perception**:
   - Through **natural language processing (NLP)**, we analyzed customer reviews and social media mentions to identify common topics related to Starbucks. These included:
     - **Pricing Complaints**: Many customers felt Starbucks was **overpriced**, with some citing the experience as not worth the premium cost.
     - **Brand Positioning**: Starbucks was seen as charging more than local competitors, justified by its **reputation, convenience, and quality**.
     - **Preference & Alternatives**: Some customers considered Starbucks as an "emergency option," preferring other coffee shops unless Starbucks was the only choice.

3. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) Analysis**:
   - We conducted an **MDS analysis** to visualize how Starbucks is perceived compared to other coffee shops. Two scenarios were explored:
     - With **Price** as an attribute, Starbucks stood out as a premium-priced brand.
     - Without **Price** as a factor, Starbucks was perceived similarly to **local coffee shops**.
   - The analysis revealed that **price** is the key factor differentiating Starbucks from its competitors.

4. **Key Findings**:
   - **Brand Misalignment**: There is a gap between Starbucksâ€™ premium positioning and how customers perceive its value.
   - **Pricing Concerns**: Many customers feel the premium prices no longer justify the Starbucks experience.
   - **Competitor Similarity**: Without considering price, Starbucks is seen as similar to local coffee shops, which may erode its competitive advantage.
   - **Critical Moment**: Starbucks is at a pivotal point and must reconsider its approach to remain competitive and retain brand value.

### Conclusion:
The project highlighted the need for Starbucks to re-evaluate its **pricing strategy** and ensure that its **brand positioning** aligns with customer perceptions. As Starbucks faces increased competition and internal challenges, this project emphasized the importance of addressing pricing concerns and refocusing its brand messaging to maintain its premium image and customer loyalty.
